## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

- **"No songs found"**
  - Try a different spelling or include artist name
  - Example: "tum hi ho arijit" instead of just "tum hi ho"

- **"Couldn't get download URL"**
  - JioSaavn's API might have changed or is temporarily unavailable
  - Try using a direct URL from the Network tab in browser developer tools

- **"Failed to play the song"**
  - Ensure you have a compatible media player installed
  - For Linux users: install audacious, vlc, mplayer, or mpv

### Media Player Not Found (Linux)

If the script can't find a suitable media player on Linux, install one of these:

```bash
# Install Audacious
sudo apt-get install audacious

# Or install VLC
sudo apt-get install vlc

# Or install MPV
sudo apt-get install mpv
```
